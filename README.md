Couchbase Mobile Developer Portal - v1.4 snapshot
=================================================

## Source of the Docs

While couchbase took down the CB Lite v1.4 documenation, the documentation site was built from a github repo.  The repo was deleted by couchbase, but anyone who contributed to the documentation over the years has a copy in their github accounts [full list](https://github.com/jlkurtz/couchbase-mobile-portal/network/members)

## Built docs are in the "generated1.4" folder

Use any static web host to view the site.  If you have php installed for example, go to the generated1.4 folder and enter `php -S localhost:4000` to have an easy web server.

## Source of assests not in this repo

After running a build following the readme instructions (See README-ORIGINAL.md), the generated site depended on assets hosted on the production couchbase site (which no longer has those files).  Those assests where taken from archive.org and commited into the generated1.4 folder.
